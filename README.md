Read this before installing the plugin.

This plugin is designed to support the minecraft version 1.21.11.

The integration of the map is highly needed because the player positioning is dependend on this map.
To use the map, add the "Lucky-Pillars Map" file to your minecraft server folder.
Delete the old "world" folder and rename the "Lucky-Pillars Map" folder to "world".
Start your server. The world Map should now be the Lucky Pillars Map.

Note: There is no build-in map reset currently. Means you either need to use a server network that does this automatically or manually reset the world after each game.
